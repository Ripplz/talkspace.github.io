#Talkspace Privacy Policy

 Rest assured, we care about your Privacy and would do nothing to intentionally compromise it.

 ##Information We Collect

 Talkspace receives or collects information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.
 ###Information You Provide

 - **Your Account Information.** You provide your mobile phone number to create a Talkspace account. You provide us the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You confirm you are authorized to provide us such numbers. You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile name, profile picture, and status message.

 - **Your Messages.** We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing our Services to you. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our servers, and they are not stored on your device after the relevant chat has ended. We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services, which is on by default. End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.

- **Customer Support.** You may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. For example, you may send us an email with information relating to our app performance or other issues.

###Automatically Collected Information

- **Usage and Log Information.** We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our Services, how you interact with others using our Services, and the like), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.

- **Status Information.** We collect information about your online and status message changes on our Services, such as whether you are online (your “online status”), when you last used our Services (your “last seen status”), and when you last updated your status message.

###Third-Party Information

- **Information Others Provide About You.** We receive information other people provide us, which may include information about you. For example, when other users you know use our Services, they may provide your phone number from their mobile address book (just as you may provide theirs), or they may send you a message, send messages to groups to which you belong, or call you.

##How We Use Information

We use all the information we have to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.

We understand how people use our Services, and analyze and use the information we have to evaluate and improve our Services, research, develop, and test new services and features, and conduct troubleshooting activities. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. We use cookies to operate, provide, improve, understand, and customize our Services.

- **Safety and Security.** We verify accounts and activity, and promote safety and security on and off our Services, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of our Terms, and to ensure our Services are being used legally.

- **No Third-Party Banner Ads.** We do not allow third-party banner ads on Talkspace. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this policy.
